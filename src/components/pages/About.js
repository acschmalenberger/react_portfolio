        <p>
        I was raised in Houston, Texas but moved to Washington, D.C. for college where i studied Public Relations. They say home is where the heart is so after years of travel and working outside of Texas, I found my way back to Houston and couldn't be happier. I love to work on projects that utilize my creativity, adaptability, eye for analysis, and problem solving skills. In my spare time I love cooking, hiking, gardening and yoga. I have a profound appreciation for the arts and design, which means you can find me at local music venues and museums often. I love new challenges and canâ€™t wait to dive into your special project!
